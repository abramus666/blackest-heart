# The Blackest Heart
https://abramus666.github.io/blackest-heart/

Turn-based dungeon crawler with combat mechanics putting emphasis on movement based attacks, inspired by great mobile game Hoplite.

Enemy types and their placement in dungeons is random. The combat, on the other hand, is completely deterministic. There are no "dice rolls" being used whatsoever. Either the player character is in a vulnerable position and is 100% guaranteed to be hit, or is safe. That makes for an environment where the success or failure depends mostly on player skill, rather than pure luck. No prayers for RNG gods are needed! (That being said, upgrading character abilities is pretty important too.)
